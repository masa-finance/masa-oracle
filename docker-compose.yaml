    # This is a named volume. You can specify additional options here if needed,
    # such as setting a specific driver, driver options, or even labeling.
    # For most users, the simple declaration is sufficient.
    # Example with explicit driver (usually not required):
    # driver: local
    # Example with labels (optional):
    # labels:
    #   - "com.example.description=MASA node key storage"
