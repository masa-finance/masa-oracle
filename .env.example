## Note: All nodes need to be staked to participate
## To stake your node:
## 1. Ensure you have Sepolia ETH from a public faucet
## 2. Ensure you have Sepolia MASA tokens run make faucet to get 1000 Sepolia MASA
## 3. Start your node and copy the Public Key from the startup logs
## 4. Use the following commands: make stake or ./masa-node --stake <amount> (e.g., ./masa-node --stake 1000 for 1000 MASA)
## 5. Wait for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain
## 6. Restart your node after staking
## Minimum stake required: 1000 Sepolia MASA

## Minimum .env configuration for running a staked node and getting data from the network
## With this configuration, you can retrieve data but cannot provide data as a worker
