## Introduction

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of utilizing Discord user data endpoints available through a hypothetical API, designed to assist developers in leveraging the power of real-time Discord data for various applications. These applications range from community analysis, user engagement tracking, to bot personalization and more. Before diving into the technical details, it's crucial to ensure that your application has the necessary Discord bot token configured. This guide will walk you through the prerequisites, offer detailed information on how to access and use the Discord user data endpoints, and provide an example use case of deploying a decentralized AI agent for community engagement analysis.

## How It Works: Processing Discord Data Requests

The API employs a service-based model to efficiently process Discord data requests, enabling real-time access to user data that is sourced through the Discord API. This section outlines the workflow from receiving a request to delivering data back to the API.

### Step 1: Initialization

A Service Manager is initialized to oversee the processing of Discord data requests. This manager acts as a coordinator, managing various services dedicated to handling individual tasks.

### Step 2: Receiving Requests

When a request for Discord user data is received, it is directed to the Service Manager. The request includes details such as the user ID and the specific data being requested.

### Step 3: Task Delegation

The Service Manager assesses the request and delegates the task to the appropriate service. Each service is responsible for a specific aspect of the request, such as fetching user profiles or guild memberships.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure your application has a Discord bot token as described in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).
- Add the Discord bot token to your application's configuration.
- Have your application running and accessible.

## Discord Endpoints

### Getting Guild and Channel IDs

To get all guilds (and their IDs) you can use the `/data/discord/guilds/all` endpoint.

> ![Get Guilds](/img/discord-get-all-guilds.png)

With the guild ID you can then use the `/data/discord/guilds/{guildID}/channels` endpoint to get all channels for that guild.

> ![Get Channels](/img/discord-get-guild-channels.png)

With the guild ID you can then use the `/data/discord/guilds/{guildID}/channels` endpoint to get all channels for that guild.

### Retrieve User Profile

The API provides one endpoint for interacting with Discord user data:

The `/data/discord/users/{userID}` endpoint retrieves a Discord user's profile. This can be particularly useful for understanding user demographics, personalizing interactions, or for further analysis in combination with other data points.

- **Endpoint:** `/data/discord/users/{userID}`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Fetches a Discord user's profile.
- **URL Parameters:**
  - `userID`: The Discord user ID of the profile you want to retrieve.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/data/discord/users/123456789012345678 \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": "123456789012345678",
  "username": "DiscordUser",
  "avatar": "a_d5efa99b3eeaa7dd43acca82f5692432",
  "banner": "a_d5efa99b3eeaa7dd43acca82f5692432",
}
```

### Retrieve Messages from a Discord Channel

> **Important**: To retrieve message content, you must toggle "Message Content Intent" in the Discord Developer Portal under the `Bot` section.
>
> ![Message Content Intent](/img/discord-message-content-intent.png)

The `/data/discord/channels/{channelID}/messages` endpoint retrieves messages from a specified Discord channel.

- **Endpoint:** `/data/discord/channels/{channelID}/messages`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Fetches messages from a Discord channel.
- **URL Parameters:**
  - `channelID`: The Discord channel ID from which you want to retrieve messages.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/data/discord/channels/123456789012345678/messages \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

Examples response

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1234456778",
    "channelID": "829302330",
    "author": {
      "id": "10923912",
      "username": "teslashibe",
      "discriminator": "string",
      "avatar": "string"
    },
    "content": "hello masa nauts!",
    "timestamp": "string"
  }
]
```

### Retrieve Channels from a Discord Guild

The `/data/discord/guilds/{guildID}/channels` endpoint retrieves channels from a specified Discord guild.

- **Endpoint:** `/data/discord/guilds/{guildID}/channels`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Fetches channels from a Discord guild.
- **URL Parameters:**
  - `guildID`: The Discord guild ID from which you want to retrieve channels.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/data/discord/guilds/123456789012345678/channels \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "12345678",
    "guildID": "2342340923",
    "name": "masa-general",
    "type": 0
  }
]
```

### Retrieve Guilds from the Discord Network

The `/data/discord/guilds/all` endpoint retrieves all available guilds that the Discord worker network is apart of.

- **Endpoint:** `/data/discord/guilds/all`
- **Method:** GET
- **Description:** Fetches guilds for the entire Discord Worker network.

#### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/data/discord/guilds/all \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

Example response:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "1234950",
    "name": "bobsbot",
    "icon": "string",
    "owner": true,
    "permissions": "string"
  }
]
```

## Use Case: Decentralized AI Agent

Imagine a decentralized AI agent, "CommunityEngageAI," designed to analyze engagement within Discord communities. This agent uses the API's Discord user data endpoints to gather real-time data on user interactions, preferences, and community roles.

### How CommunityEngageAI Leverages AI

1 . **Data Collection:** CommunityEngageAI sends queries to the various endpoints to fetch profiles of active community members, messages from channels, and other relevant data.

2 . **Engagement Analysis:** Upon retrieving the data, CommunityEngageAI employs AI models to analyze engagement patterns, identify key influencers, and understand user demographics.

3 . **Personalized Interactions:** Leveraging the insights gained, CommunityEngageAI customizes interactions with community members, tailoring messages and content to enhance engagement and user satisfaction.

### Conclusion

The provided endpoints offer valuable resources for developing applications that interact with Discord user data in real-time. By leveraging these endpoints, developers can create sophisticated AI agents capable of analyzing and enhancing community engagement on Discord. These agents offer deep insights into user behavior and community dynamics, providing valuable intelligence for community managers and content creators.
