# Masa Node LLM Chat Feature

The Masa Node introduces an innovative feature for interacting with large language models (LLMs) through chat. This functionality acts as a proxy, allowing users to communicate with any LLM, whether it's hosted locally or through a larger service like OpenAI. The feature is designed to be flexible, supporting various data structures depending on the specific LLM being used.

## Overview

The LLM Chat feature enhances the Masa Node's capabilities, enabling users to leverage the power of advanced language models for generating responses to queries. This feature is particularly useful for developers and researchers looking to integrate conversational AI into their applications without directly managing the complexities of LLM APIs.

## How It Works

The LLM Chat handler functions by forwarding user requests directly to the specified LLM endpoint. The structure of the request and response must conform to the format expected by the target LLM, making it the caller's responsibility to ensure compatibility.

### Request Structure

The request structure varies based on the LLM being targeted. For example, when interacting with ollama, the request might look like this:

```
{
    "model": "llama3",
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "why is the sky blue?"
        }
    ],
    "stream": false
}
```

However, for services like OpenAI's GPT models, the request structure would follow their API specifications, focusing on a prompt and other parameters like temperature and max tokens.

### Proxying Requests

To use the LLM Chat feature, you simply send a POST request to the Masa Node endpoint designated for LLM chat interactions. The body of your request should match the structure expected by the LLM you're querying.

> POST to the endpoint `/v1/api/chat`


### URLs for Data Structure Formats

For detailed information on the data structure formats required by different LLMs, refer to their official documentation:

- **OpenAI (GPT models):** [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)
- **Anthropic (Claude models):** [Anthropic API Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/reference/complete_post)
- **Ollama:** [Ollama API Documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md)

### Example Usage

To interact with an LLM through the Masa Node, follow these steps:

1. Determine the request structure required by the LLM you wish to use.
2. Format your request accordingly, including the model name and any necessary parameters.
3. Send a POST request to the `/v1/api/chat` endpoint of the Masa Node with your formatted request body.

The Masa Node will forward your request to the LLM and return the response, allowing you to integrate conversational AI capabilities seamlessly into your applications.

## Running your own LLM

You will need to set an environment variable `LLM_CHAT_URL` to the value that corresponds to your Ollama instance's URL. This setup allows your Masa Node to communicate with the LLM through Ollama, leveraging its capabilities to process and respond to queries.

### Setting Up Ollama

Ollama provides a straightforward and flexible way to host and manage LLMs, including models from OpenAI or custom-trained models. To set up Ollama for your use case, follow these steps:

1. **Install Ollama**: Visit the [Ollama GitHub repository](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/docs) and follow the installation instructions provided in the documentation.

2. **Pull Your Desired Models**: Ollama supports a variety of models. You can pull the specific models you wish to serve through your Masa Node. Detailed instructions on importing models can be found in the [Importing Models](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/import.md) section of the Ollama documentation.

3. **Configure Ollama**: After installing Ollama and pulling your models, configure Ollama according to your requirements. This may involve setting up endpoints, adjusting performance settings, and ensuring compatibility with the models you intend to use.

4. **Set LLM_CHAT_URL**: With Ollama configured, set the `LLM_CHAT_URL` in your `.env` file to point to your Ollama instance's URL. This ensures that your Masa Node can route LLM chat requests to Ollama.

5. **Test Your Setup**: Finally, test your setup by sending a request to your Masa Node that should be handled by the LLM. Verify that the request is correctly processed by Ollama and that the expected response is returned. This will usually be: `localhost:8080/api/v1/chat`

By following these steps, you can enhance your Masa Node with the ability to serve responses from LLMs, opening up a wide range of possibilities for natural language processing, chat functionalities, and more.

For more detailed information on setting up and using Ollama, refer to the [Ollama Documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/tree/main/docs).


### Conclusion

The LLM Chat feature of the Masa Node offers a versatile and powerful tool for developers and researchers to interact with large language models. By acting as a proxy, it simplifies the process of integrating advanced conversational AI into various applications, providing flexibility and ease of use.
